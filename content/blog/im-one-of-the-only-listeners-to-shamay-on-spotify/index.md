title: I'm one of the only listeners to Shamay on Spotify
---

SHAMAY is a Russian-language rapper I found on Spotify through the algorithm. I really like his songs Luna ("Moon") and Sviter ("Sweater"), even though I don't speak Russian.

According to [UrbanDictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shamay), s*hamay* is a "Russian Chechen who throws fries at others", or a gay person. Whatever. I hope this guy releases more songs in any case.

Update on 10/19/2020: I am still the #2 listener and only follower of Shamay.
