My new single "I'm Okay" is now available on [iTunes](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/1592784321) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/30wB0mfWHwiLfcIVgszAJ6?si=lNNnH8vKR4KpSq_LMfS6VQ).

The cover art is a photograph of me, taken a year or so before the song was made, by the artist [Joanna Moyer-Battick](https://www.jomoyerbattick.com/). Her prints are joyfully phantasmagorical, and I encourage everyone to stop by her e-shop to pick up a few.

I produced this song in 2012/2013 but only just now am I making the moves (i.e. spending the money) to distribute & monetize it. If nothing else I'd like to retain exclusive rights to publish as "Ankit Chaudhari", since AFAIK it's the most original IP I own, and putting out this single is the first step in securing those rights.
