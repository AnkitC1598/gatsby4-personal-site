This is my first blog post. I am trying to do it my own way, which means writing markdown and manually adding pages to an array before compiling the site. It's a shame I can't use a database to store my posts, but at this time I don't have a reliable service for that.

_To Do_:

- Get a database
- Put blog posts on database
- Get blog posts from database
