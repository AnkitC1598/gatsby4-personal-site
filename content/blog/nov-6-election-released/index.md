This is a bit old already, but I've published a second single to [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/4CJJ7RDN1mtanyFc6TpMhH?si=3bcdc57065454a97) et. al.

The cover art is a photograph I took at the Baltimore aquarium in 2021. The song I made in 2012/2013 during a time of some emotional turmoil.
